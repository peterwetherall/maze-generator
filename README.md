# maze-generator
Warm your CPU while drawing cool maze patterns.

A HTML5 canvas project which draws a unique "maze-like" pattern which can then be saved as an image.

**Demo:** [https://peterwetherall.github.io/maze-generator/](https://peterwetherall.github.io/maze-generator/)

### Future ideas ðŸ’¡

- Make the program less resource intensive (move away from current brute-force approach)
- Take a user input as a seed to generate the maze rather than pseudorandom numbers
- Allow a user to navigate a character through their maze to a specific goal, once it has generated
